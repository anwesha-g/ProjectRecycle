As plastic accumulates in our oceans and beaches, the issue of plastic pollution has become a global crisis. In nature, everything from nature always returns back to nature, through decomposition. However, due to plastic’s unnatural properties, it takes eons to decompose. Thus, the plastic simply joins Earth’s landfills, which in numbers, is 85% of all plastics produced simply ending up in landfills or oceans. It is even worse when we realize that most plastics are never recycled. According to the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development, less than 10% of plastic is recycled worldwide. In the face of plastic pollution, when there seems to be no way of directly stopping it, there are ways people can reduce or slow the amount of plastic pollution. Recycling is one clear response, but people find it easier to simply dump all their waste into one bin, without using the three divided cans. This adds to our global plastic pollution crisis, which could be slowed if there is technology provided to recycle our waste for us. It reduces the issue of not knowing if something is recyclable, or making recycling much easier and efficient. Overall, the issue of recycling efficiently and effectively, as well as increasing the accessibility of recycling to make sure it happens more often, is an issue that needs to be addressed in order to slow the plastic pollution crisis.
